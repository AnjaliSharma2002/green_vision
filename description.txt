This project is about predicting the type of forest in specific area based on its physical and environmental features:
elevation, soil type, distance from water,based on sunlight

Why we need to create environment for the new project?
to create a environment we use VENV module(which is inbuilt in package within the python which is use to create the environment)

what is setup.py?
setup.py is the build script for setup tools, a tool used to package and distribute python projects. It's like a blueprint that tells a python how to install your project.
Think of it as the entry point for turing your ML project to reusable python package.

module -> package -> library

if you add __init__.py in a folder, the python will treat the folder as a package.

library is a group is packages

1. package your ML project -> easily reuse and install your code anywhere using the pip install
2. define dependencies
3. API entry points
4. enabels colaboration
5. create versioned models

setuptools -> python library -> package, distribute and install python projects
python setup.py install

problem statement -> we need to find the forest type (dataset)
-> EDA -> feature extraction -> feature selection -> model training -> model hyperparameter tuning -> deployment model
1. Data ingestion (data collection)(raw)
2. EDA or analysis of the data
3. feature extraction and selection
4. model building + evaluation
5. deployment of model

pipeline :-
-> training pipeline
-> prediction pipeline

training pipeline :-> data ingestion -> data transformation -> model trainer -> evaluation

pridiction pipeline:->

frontend (test data) and backend (flask)

-----

In notebooks folder, we will perform the EDA and store the sample data.

-----

utils folder includes all the functions which are used through out the project

other folders in src:
1. exceptions
2. logging

----
In exception folder
error is the actual exception object (eg. zero division error)
error_detail is expected to be the sys module so you can call and sys.exc_info()

---------

make_readable: bool = False

to treat the string like a file -> strin IO
-> string io is like fake file that lives in the memory not your desk
-> it lets you read from or write to a string as it were a file

---------

what is a data class?
A data class is a short cut in python to create classes that are mainly used to store data.

It's automatically creates:
1. __init__()  -> for assigning values
2. __repr__() -> for easy printing
3. __eq__() -> for comparision
