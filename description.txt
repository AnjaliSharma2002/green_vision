This project is about predicting the type of forest in specific area based on its physical and environmental features:
elevation, soil type, distance from water,based on sunlight

Why we need to create environment for the new project?
to create a environment we use VENV module(which is inbuilt in package within the python which is use to create the environment)

what is setup.py?
setup.py is the build script for setup tools, a tool used to package and distribute python projects. It's like a blueprint that tells a python how to install your project.
Think of it as the entry point for turing your ML project to reusable python package.

module -> package -> library

if you add __init__.py in a folder, the python will treat the folder as a package.

library is a group is packages

1. package your ML project -> easily reuse and install your code anywhere using the pip install
2. define dependencies
3. API entry points
4. enabels colaboration
5. create versioned models

setuptools -> python library -> package, distribute and install python projects
python setup.py install
